# Joseph Land

A 2D portfolio disguised as a game.

What happens when you give one determined human WiFi, ambition, and no adult supervision?
You get this.

Explore boldly.
If you are a hirer, please end his unemployment arc.
(That last part is legally not a joke.)

WASD or click/tap to move.
Turn on volume for immersion.
Or don't. Live in silence. That's your storyline.

## How to run

You need Node.js and npm. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL it prints.
Try not to get emotionally attached.

---

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

A `dist` folder will appear.
This is real. You did not hallucinate it.

---

## How to preview the build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Congratulations. You are now playtesting Joseph.

## Who and what you will find

### On the island (outside)

- **The Slime** – Your first encounter. It explains Joseph Land. It is also a slime. Budget constraints were involved. It has personality.
- **Wenzheng** – Grand Master (Managing Director) of the Data Guild. Once attempted to stump Joseph. Joseph replied with performance metrics. He is still recovering.
- **Janet** – Keeper (Executive Director) of the Data Guild. Signs approval scrolls while Joseph reorganizes reality. Encourages you to hire him before another kingdom does.
- **Evan** – Vice President. Gave Joseph an impossible timeline. Joseph finished early. Legacy systems fear him.
- **Chest 1 & Chest 2** – Wooden. Locked. Suspicious. We are not elaborating.

### Inside the house (the room)

- **Dad** – Early-stage investor. ROI looking strong. Hiring Joseph directly impacts retirement stability. This is not subtle.
- **Mom** – Built Joseph from scratch. Already told every auntie he is successful. You are now part of this narrative.
- **Kiki** – Small dog. Emotionally powerful. Treat economy depends on Joseph's employment status.
- **Moca** – Also a dog. Cute beyond negotiation. A no-hire scenario may trigger snack austerity measures.
- **Ceyline** – Rich Indochinese girlfriend. If you do not hire Joseph, he will tragically survive on her large trust fund. Villas. Yachts. Financial peace. Please do not force this outcome.

### Things you can click on

- **Computer** – Claims Joseph knows all programming languages. Evidence and possible exaggeration on GitHub.
- **TV** – Currently playing 10 uninterrupted hours of something boomers consider thrilling.
- **Fridge** – Contains historical artifacts. Possibly sentient dairy.
- **Diploma** – Master's in CS from UPenn. Proof that someone who once fought a printer driver survived the Ivy League.
- **Game console** – Valorant instalock duelist behavior. No apologies. Also evangelizes Suikoden II aggressively.
- **Coffee machine** – Could also be a printer. No one is certain.
- **Shelves** – Books. Many books. Reading status classified.
- **Resume** – On the desk. Highly optimized flex document. Open before it updates itself.
- **Drawers** – Clothes and cables. The universal constant.

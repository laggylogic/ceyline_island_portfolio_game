# Ceyline Island

A 2D portfolio disguised as a game.

What happens when you give one determined human WiFi, ambition, and no adult supervision?
You get this.

Explore boldly.
If you are a hirer, please end his unemployment arc.
(That last part is legally not a joke.)

WASD or click/tap to move.
Turn on volume for immersion.
Or don't. Live in silence. That's your storyline.

## How to run

You need Node.js and npm. Then:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL it prints.
Try not to get emotionally attached.

---

## How to build

```bash
npm run build
```

A `dist` folder will appear.
This is real. You did not hallucinate it.

---

## How to preview the build

```bash
npm run preview
```

Congratulations. You are now playtesting Joseph.

## Who and what you will find

### On the island (outside)

- **The Bunny** – Welcomes you the moment you spawn and delivers a surprisingly professional briefing. Soft. Polite. Slightly overqualified. Knows exactly what’s on this island and why you’re here.
- **Joseph** – Ceyline’s financially minimalist boyfriend.Currently operating between ambition and rent. Supportive, hopeful and mildly unemployed. Strategically invested in Ceyline’s long-term financial success.
- **The Guard** – Stationed at the gate by parental decree. Keeps Ceyline’s trust fund locked and safe from absolutely everyone. Yes, even her. Until further notice, she must venture out, collect experience, and grind her own gold like a responsible protagonist.

### Inside the house (the room)

- **Aurellya** – Ceyline’s sister. Retired IT developer who escaped the tech life and is now drafting a bold retirement plan: opening a bakery. Strategically invested in Ceyline’s future income streams. Call it “family collaboration.” It is not optional.
- **The Ghost** – Floats near the study table. Says nothing. Judges everything. Somehow louder when deadlines exist.

### Things you can click on

- **Computer** – The command center where code gets written, bugs get negotiated, and Valorant gets dangerously competitive.GitHub contains evidence. And confidence. Runs primarily on matcha, ambition, and occasional pocket sage behavior.
- **Study Table** –  Where ambitions sit, deadlines loom, and dramatic life decisions are made at 2am.
- **Diploma** – Proof she survived morning classes, deadlines, and group projects. Officially educated. Emotionally seasoned.
- **Matcha Station** – The true power source of Ceyline Island. Whisks ambition into existence. Productivity increases by 37% per cup. Non-negotiable ritual.
- **Coffee machine** – Could also be a printer. No one is certain.
- **Fridge** – A quiet reflection of the current economic storyline. Functional. Hopeful. Awaiting a plot twist.
